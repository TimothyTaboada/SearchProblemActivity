## Nani the hecc?
Basically, I'm tryna recreate the second level of the Labyrinth minigame from [this game](https://threshold.itch.io/monster-girl-dreams), without the traps though since I wanna keep it simple.

## How do?
Based on my observations of the AI pathing when I played the minigame (only played it twice), Ceris (the red one) generally takes the most direct path to the player while Beris (the blue one) does some wonky shit which makes it look like she's tryna cut off escape routes.  
With this in mind, I'll just assume that Ceris uses BFS, and Beris uses DFS.

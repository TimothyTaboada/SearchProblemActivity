## Nani the hecc?
Basically, I'm tryna recreate the first 2 levels of the Labyrinth minigame, without the traps though.

## How do?
Based on their pathing when I played those levels (only did em twice), Ceris generally takes the most direct path to the player while Beris does some wonky shit which makes it look like she's tryna cut off escape routes.  
With this in mind, I'll just assume that Ceris uses BFS, and Beris uses DFS.

## What is this?
Basically, I'm tryna recreate the second level of the Labyrinth minigame from [this game](https://threshold.itch.io/monster-girl-dreams), without Beris (the blue circle) and the stage hazards though since I wanna keep it simple (and I'm running out of time).

## How to implement?
Based on my observations of the AI pathing when I played the minigame (only played it twice), Ceris (the red circle) generally takes the most direct path to the player.  
With this in mind, I'll just assume that Ceris uses BFS.
